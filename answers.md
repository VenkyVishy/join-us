## Let's hack!

Please answer in the language that you're
applying for. We're a JS shop, so answers in JS
get extra üç™

- Find the longest word in a string.
  - Given `The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog` is the input to your function, it should return `jumped`.
var a="the quick browns fox jumped over the lazy dog";
var b=a.split(" ");
b.sort();
var min=100000000000000, max=0;
var temp="";
for(var i=0;i<b.length;i++){
  
    if(max<b[i].length){
      max=b[i].length;
      temp=b[i];
    }
  
}
console.log(temp);
- Repeat a string `n` times.
  - If `abc` and `3` are the arguments to your function, it shoudl return `abcabcabc`
var a="abc";
var n=3;
console.log(a.repeat(n));
- Remove duplicates in an array
  - If `[1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3]` is the input to your
  function, it should return `[1, 20, 3]`
  
var a=[1,20,3,1,3,3];
console.log([...new Set(a)]);
- Remove falsy values
  - If `[42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"]` is the input to your function, it should return `[42, "everything", 2, "everything"]`
var array1 = [42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"];
 
var filtered = array1.filter(x => x);
console.log(filtered);
- Truncate a string
  - If `'Absolute victory'` and `3` are the inputs to
  your function, it should return `Abs...`
var a="Absolute victory";
var n=3,i=0;
var temp="";
for(var i=0;i<n;i++) {
  temp+=a[i];
}
console.log(temp);

- We look for style and patterns when reviewing submissions.
- Please __do not__ lift answers from somewhere and
