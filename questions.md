## Let's hack!

Please answer in the language that you're
applying for. We're a JS shop, so answers in JS
get extra üç™

- Find the longest word in a string.
  - Given `The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog` is the input to your function, it should return `jumped`.
var a= "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
var b=a.split(" ")
var max=0,min=1000000000;
var i=0;
var temp="";
for(i=0;i<b.length;i++){
  if(max<b[i].length){
    max=b[i].length;
    temp=b[i];
  }
}
console.log(temp);
- Repeat a string `n` times.
  - If `abc` and `3` are the arguments to your function, it shoudl return `abcabcabc`
  var a="abc"
  var n=3
  console.log(a.repeat(n))

- Remove duplicates in an array
  - If `[1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3]` is the input to your
  function, it should return `[1, 20, 3]`
  var a=[1,20,3,1,3,3]
  console.log(...new Set(a))

- Remove falsy values
  - If `[42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"]` is the input to your function, it should return `[42, "everything", 2, "everything"]`
var a=[42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"];
var filtered=a.filter(Boolean);
console.log(filtered);
- Truncate a string
  - If `'Absolute victory'` and `3` are the inputs to
  your function, it should return `Abs...`
var a="Absolute value";
var n=3;
var i=0;
var temp="";
for(i=0;i<n;i++){
  temp+=a[i];
}
console.log(temp);
## Notes

- We look for style and patterns when reviewing submissions.
- Please __do not__ lift answers from somewhere and
send it to us verbatim.
- Do show off your git kung-fu. Multiple commits? Branch naming?
- If you can't answer everything, thats ok too! Go ahead and raise that PR anyway.
